## Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

I have developed a web application for playing Tic-Tac-Toe using the Vue.js CDN framework. This project served as a platform for me to delve deeply into Vue.js and gain a comprehensive understanding of its lifecycle hooks.

The application is now fully functional and visually appealing. I encourage you to explore it further by forking the repository and examining its features and aesthetics.

### Project Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe web application that allows two individuals to engage in the game on a single device.

### Technologies Used:
1. Javascript
2. HTML/CSS
3. VueJS CDN

### How to run the application:

No additional dependencies need to be installed, as I have utilized the VueJS CDN version, which requires no local setup. You can fork the repository and directly open the HTML file to play the game.

Alternatively, you can run the app on a live server using the following command:
```
live-server .
```
Ensure that you are in the correct directory while serving the application. Enjoy the game!
